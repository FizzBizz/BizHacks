# Discover: Connect Your Teams
## Overview
Discover is a web platform we envisioned for the 2019 BizHacks hackathon. We were given 24 hours to design a solution for one of Best Buy's various challenges they face.

## The Problem
Within a tech company, there can be dozens of teams working on different parts of the same product. Often times, individual teams are focused on their portion of the product. This leads to a siloing of knowledge and experience, which can cause bigger issues when faced with tough challenges requiring cross-team collaboration or specialized knowledge.

From talking to developers from Best Buy, a common sentiment is that they often feel helpless when they encounter a part of the app/website they are unfamiliar with. They try to reach out to colleagues in Slack channels requesting assistance, but those requests quickly get buried among other messages and often go unanswered. This results in longer turnaround times for bug fixes and can even delay release of new features.

## Our Solution
To solve this issue, we envisioned a web platform that would allow teams and individuals to break down those silos and connect with other employees who have specific skillsets and experiences. Our platform would allow employees to search through a database of their colleagues by criterias such as product area, technical skills or past experience. It integrates with Slack and email, allowing for instant connection to the right people. 

This platform can empower junior employees by providing opportunities to foster mentorship. While managers can leverage this tool to search for existing talent for upcoming projects or open positions. Overall, this platform aims to promote a welcoming comopany culture that encourages helping and connecting with colleagues. 

We built the POC using JavaScript and Bootstrap. You can find it at https://fizzbizz.github.io/BizHacks.
